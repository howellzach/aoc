# Advent of Code - Zach Howell's Answers

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. This repository holds my submission/answers for these challenges.

I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about coding generally and to try out new languages. 

## Year Attempts
- 2020: Python
  - I was still quite fresh into learning Python and only made it to Day 3 before throwing in the towel. May attempt more days at a later time since puzzles are still available. 
- 2021: Go
  - Trying to learn Golang. I'll sometimes fall back to Python to check my understanding of the puzzle. Enjoy my highly inefficient and likely bad answers in Go.
